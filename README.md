### iOS Test Automation

There are 2 types of automated tests in iOS:

*   Unit test:
        test a specific case in a class.
        make sure that the class works independently on its own.
*   UI test:
        is also called Integration test.
        test user interactions with the app.
        make sure that all classes fit well together.
