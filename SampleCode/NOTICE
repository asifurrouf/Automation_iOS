vodQA - Sample cross platform app built using reactNative.
Reason for building the cross platform app using reactNative is to get over the obstacles of automating apps
built using react native and to write a single script to automate cross platform apps using Appium.
vodQA app code is open sourced here and same was used for various appium workshops conducted by ThoughtWorks.

Same is available for all community activities without any license required/ involved.

Application holds all possible gestures like slide, swipe, longpress, doubletap, DragAndDrop and also webview.
